# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
This week I managed to successfully do the following

-Containerize Application ( Write backend-flask/Dockerfile frontend-react-js/Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
-Document the Notification Endpoint for the OpenAI Document
-Write a Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications
-Run DynamoDB Local Container and ensure it works by creating an item, listing tables and getting records
-Run Postgres Container and ensure it works (initially struggled with connecting to the database then added database extension)
